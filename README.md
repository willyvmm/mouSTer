### mouSTer history:

mouSTer was born as a **hid2st** device around autumn 2013. The first hardware revision was based on the almost unknown **FTDI Vinculum II** (VNC2) chip. Unfortunately that was the worst development decision ever. I would say that was a shoot into knee at the beginning of the journey. Don't touch this chip.
Since then the hardware platform changed three times, and around autumn **2018 the mouSTer** got it's final physical shape.
On the other end - the firmware went through same bumpy way. 
- 4 hardware revisions and 3 times firmware revisions made from scratch.
- the latest 3'rd firmware is 17 major revision, and ca 3500 build number. (at the time of writing)

#### The mouSTer Family

### mouSTer is leading the way.

I may proudly say, the shape presented by the **mouSTer** has been unofficially adopted as a standard.
There are more devices shown up on the marked recently that use same physical shape . Also some firmware features was successfully adopted in another products.
###### So ... stay tuned. More to come.
