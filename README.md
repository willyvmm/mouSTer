### mouSTer history:

![mouSTer pac](/assets/images/mouSTer_pac.jpg)

mouSTer was born as a **hid2st** device around autumn 2013. The first hardware revision was based on the almost unknown **FTDI Vinculum II** (VNC2) chip. Unfortunately, that was the worst development decision ever. I would say that was a shoot to the knee at the beginning of the journey. Don't touch this chip.
Since then the hardware platform changed three times, and around autumn 2018 the mouSTer got its final physical shape. On the other end - the firmware went through the same bumpy way. 
- 4 hardware revisions and 3 times firmware revisions made from scratch.
- the latest 3.x firmware has 17 major revisions and has circa 4000 effective code lines + libraries (at the time of writing)

#### The mouSTer Family

***
### mouSTer is leading the way.

I may proudly say, the shape that the **mouSTer** presents have been unofficially adopted as a standard.
There are more devices shown up on the market recently that use the same physical shape. Also, some firmware features were successfully adopted in other products.
###### So ... stay tuned. More to come.
